raid 1 to 0 converter

Converts linux MD version 0.90 raid 1 to raid 0.  It's very rough, since it's mostly for my personal use, but someone 
else might find it useful.

building

gcc -o raid1to0 lib1to0.c raid1to0.c

running

./raid1to0 device1 device2 device3 ...

example: ./raid1to0 /dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdc

It takes no other arguments, and it gives you no chance to abort before it begins.  It'll print out a lot of 
information provided in the superblock, then begin.  It'll show progess as "current chunk/total chunks" then report 
completion, or error.  On an error after the process has started, some filesystem damage has occurred and recovery 
may be difficult or impossible.
